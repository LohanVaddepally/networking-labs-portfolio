#Networking Labs Portfolio

Hands-on networking labs demonstrating routing, switching, VLANs, OSPF, ACLs, and network troubleshooting using physical lab equipment and Cisco Packet Tracer.


This repository contains hands-on networking labs and assignments completed as part of my college networking coursework. These labs were performed using both Cisco Packet Tracer and physical networking equipment in a lab environment.

Skills Demonstrated
Routing and Switching fundamentals
VLAN configuration and inter-VLAN routing
Static and dynamic routing (OSPFv2)
DHCP configuration
Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
Network troubleshooting and verification
Technical documentation and network diagrams
Tools & Technologies
Cisco Packet Tracer
Physical switches, routers, and cabling
TCP/IP, VLANs, OSPF, ACLs, STP
Network diagrams and lab documentation
Each folder in this repository represents an individual lab or assignment and includes configuration files, diagrams, and a short explanation of the work performed.

## How to Review These Labs
Each lab folder contains:
- A PDF with objectives, topology, and configurations
- Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files where applicable
- Network diagrams and screenshots

Reviewers can open any lab folder and directly access the lab documentation.
