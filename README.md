# Networking Labs Portfolio
Hands-on networking labs demonstrating routing, switching, VLANs, OSPF, ACLs, and network troubleshooting using physical lab equipment  and Cisco Packet Tracer.


This repository contains hands-on networking labs and assignments completed as part of my college networking coursework. These labs were performed using both Cisco Packet Tracer and physical networking equipment in a lab environment.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Routing and Switching fundamentals
- VLAN configuration and inter-VLAN routing
- Static and dynamic routing (OSPFv2)
- DHCP configuration
- Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Network troubleshooting and verification
- Technical documentation and network diagrams

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Physical switches, routers, and cabling
- TCP/IP, VLANs, OSPF, ACLs, STP
- Network diagrams and lab documentation

Each folder in this repository represents an individual lab or assignment and includes configuration files, diagrams, and a short explanation of the work performed.
